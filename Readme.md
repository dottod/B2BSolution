## Database Architecture and ADF Pipeline Flow
The database architecture of the B2B solution plays a crucial role in storing and managing the data. It is designed using SQL Server and follows industry-standard practices for data modeling and organization. The database schema provides a structured representation of the entities and their relationships within the system.
